# Project Title:  Java Calculator

## Motivation: 
In this project I will build a basic 'calculator' programme using Java. <br />

## Notes:
The %d operator is used as a placeholder to specify integer values, decimals, or numbers. It allows us to print numbers within strings or other values. The %d operator is put where the integer is to be specified. Floating-point numbers are converted automatically to decimal values.<br />

The %n is a platform-independent newline character.<br />

Note: instead of first compiling with javac, and then running the program with java, we can do both in one step and write: <br />
java Calculator.java<br />
